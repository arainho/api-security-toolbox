This branch is dedicated to experimenting around automatic and manual flows related to security testing for APIs.

## 1 - workdlists bundle
Collect several wordlists and build a bundle.

## 2 - build docker image for api-sec-toolbox
The [api-sec-toolbox](https://hub.docker.com/r/arainho/api-sec-toolbox) is a swiss knife for API security testing.

NOTES: Builds are still failing and docker image is not published yet
