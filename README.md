# awesome-api-security - Development branch 

This _branch is dedicated to experimenting_ around automatic and manual flows related to security testing for APIs.

## 1 - workdlists bundle
Collect several wordlists and build a bundle.

## 2 - build docker image for api-sec-toolbox
The [api-sec-toolbox](https://hub.docker.com/r/arainho/api-sec-toolbox) is a swiss knife for API security testing.
Please note that builds are still failing and docker image is not published yet.

**WARNING: This is not a final product, use it at your own risk.**
